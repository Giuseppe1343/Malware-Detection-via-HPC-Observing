# Introduction
In this research, we want to detecting malware with Hardware performance counter . Due to the malware behaviors , they can obfuscate himself but we now that the wolf is wolf even if he wears sheepâ€™skin. %95 malware behavior same. In this paper we are proof that with observing 300 malicious software and normal software.

# Prerequisities
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The project was written/tested on Windows.

You need to the [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) installation on your computer.
### Required Libraries
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/)
- [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
- [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/getting_started/#installing-keras-3)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/getting_started/#installation-quick-start)

# Results
> [!WARNING]
> If you are going to use ready-made models, you should scale your dataset using MinMaxScaler() for MMS.h5 and StandardScaler() for SS.h5.
> The SS model is the model with the highest success rate we have achieved.

> If you want to monitor your data yourself, it would be useful to read the "[HPC_manuel.pdf](https://github.com/Giuseppe1343/Malware-Detection-via-HPC-Observing/blob/main/Malware-Detection-HPC/HPC_manuel.pdf)"  file.
